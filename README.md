# Midterm Lab Task 1
This portfolio shows how I cleaned and organized a transactional database by applying data normalization. The dataset has multiple related tables to improve structure and remove duplicate data.  

## Step-by-Step Process  

### Step 1: Preparing the Data  
- Loaded the raw file  
- Adjusted column width and height  
- Trimmed extra spaces and words  
- Removed empty (Null) values  
- Removed duplicate entries  

### Step 2: Normalization Process  
- Applied First Normal Form (1NF)  
- Split tables based on Second Normal Form (2NF)  
- Applied Second Normal Form (2NF)  
- Created a physical data model based on normalization
